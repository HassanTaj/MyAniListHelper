### Problem

 As an everyday Anilist user there are some problems i am facing while adding new anime to my Anilist profile, because first i have to maintain a local list from where I move all the stored anime names to Anilist using my desktop browser.  
It takes a lot of time and it gets frustrating when after so many clicks and key strokes I find out that I've already watched it or it is completed.

### Solution

The solution is as follows:

**Features:**

- Login User
- Get all the user data and sync it into App db
- Provide a screen for search where user can
- Enter a term and search for existing anime
- If it's not found provide a button to search for the anime from Anilist
- The search result than should show a tile that helps user add the anime to Anilist profile with 1 click.

**Challenging Features:**

- Add settings page
  - Allow user to control sync time and occurrence
  - Allow user to view previously available anime that were previously synced from Anilist
  - Allow user to Logout
